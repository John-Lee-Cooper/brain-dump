### Jekyll
Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/John-Lee-Cooper/brain-dump/settings).
The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

---------------------------------

1. Be conversational

Your writing should be in a conversational tone such that your readers will feel like you’re talking to them personally.


2. Be straight to the point

Time is precious and humans have an attention span of nine seconds on average.
Don’t waste time with lengthy introductions or updates. Start making points and telling your story immediately to deliver what you’ve got for readers.
This principle works well for crafting your headline to make readers feel it is worth their time to read your article by having a self-explanatory and conversational headline.
Your article headlines play one of the most important factors to let readers decide if they want to click and read your articles.


3. Be real, and tell stories

Write what you know and be authentic. Authenticity always wins.
Tell stories. Everyone likes stories.
I often try my best to explain technical concepts through stories — be it my own story or others.


4. Be receptive to feedback, including criticism

Always try to seek feedback from your readers — be it positive or negative — to learn how to improve your writing.


5. Be consistent

Without consistency, your articles will have a hard time gaining traction and getting noticed by readers.
A great piece of writing comes from practising the craft of writing consistently through continuous improvement.
Being consistent also means not giving up despite any obstacles.
It is hard to start writing everytime as you may feel like you have nothing to share.
