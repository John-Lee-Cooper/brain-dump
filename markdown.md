Combined emphasis with **_asterisks and _underscores_**

Inline Code with `back ticks`

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces.
I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
