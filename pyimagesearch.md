optimization algorithm that can be used to learn a set of classifier
coefficients for parameterized learning. However, the “vanilla” implementation
of gradient descent can be prohibitively slow to run on large datasets — in
fact, it can even be considered computationally wasteful. Instead, we should
apply Stochastic […]

In previous tutorials, I’ve discussed two important loss functions: Multi-
class SVM loss and cross-entropy loss (which we usually refer to in
conjunction with Softmax classifiers). In order to to keep our discussions of
these loss functions straightforward, I purposely left out an important
component: regularization. While our loss function allows us to determine how
well (or poorly) our […]

### [Softmax Classifiers Explained](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/09/12/softmax-classifiers-explained)
Last week, we discussed Multi-class SVM loss; specifically, the hinge loss and
squared hinge loss functions. A loss function, in the context of Machine
Learning and Deep Learning, allows us to quantify how “good” or “bad” a given
classification function (also called a “scoring function”) is at correctly
classifying data points in our dataset. However, […]

### [Multi-class SVM Loss](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/09/05/multi-class-svm-loss)

data and class labels, and actually learn a function that maps the input to
the output predictions, simply by defining a set of parameters and optimizing
over them. Our linear classification tutorial focused […]

higher accuracy for nearly any machine learning algorithm […]

### [ImageNet classification with Python and Keras](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/08/10/imagenet-classification-with-python-and-keras)
Normally, I only publish blog posts on Monday, but I’m so excited about this
one that it couldn’t wait and I decided to hit the publish button early. You
see, just a few days ago, François Chollet pushed three Keras models (VGG16,
VGG19, and ResNet50) online — these networks are pre-trained on the ImageNet
dataset, meaning that they can recognize 1,000 […]

### [Detecting cats in images with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/06/20/detecting-cats-in-images-with-opencv)
Did you know that OpenCV can detect cat faces in images…right out-of-the-box
with no extras? I didn’t either. But after Kendrick Tan broke the story, I had
to check it out for myself…and do a little investigative work to see how this
cat detector seemed to sneak its way into the OpenCV repository without me
noticing (much […]

specifically in “utility” programs (such as building a dataset […]

### [How to install CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN for deep learning](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/07/04/how-to-install-cuda-toolkit-and-cudnn-for-deep-learning)
If you’re serious about doing any type of deep learning, you should be
utilizing your GPU rather than your CPU. And the more GPUs you have, the
better off you are. If you already have an NVIDIA supported GPU, then the next
logical step is to install two important libraries: The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit: A
development environment for building […]


### [OpenCV, RPi.GPIO, and GPIO Zero on the Raspberry Pi](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/05/09/opencv-rpi-gpio-and-gpio-zero-on-the-raspberry-pi)
Last week we learned a bit about Python virtual environments and how to access
the RPi.GPIO and GPIO Zero libraries along with OpenCV. Today we are going to
build on that knowledge and create an “alarm” that triggers both an LED light
to turn on and a buzzer to go off whenever a specific visual action takes
place. […]

### [Accessing RPi.GPIO and GPIO Zero with OpenCV + Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/05/02/accessing-rpi-gpio-and-gpio-zero-with-opencv-python)
I can’t believe this is the first time I am writing a blog post on GPIO and
the Raspberry Pi. It’s a pretty big mistake on my part. I should have written
this post much earlier. You see, on average, I receive 1-3 emails per week
along the lines of: When I use the ‘cv’ […]

concept, but I think many instructors (myself included) […]

### [Displaying a video feed with OpenCV and Tkinter](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/05/30/displaying-a-video-feed-with-opencv-and-tkinter)
I said it in last week’s blog post and I’ll say it again here today — I am
not, by any stretch of the imagination, a GUI developer. I think my aversion
to GUI development started back in early-High school when I was teaching
myself Java; specifically, how to write Java applets (remember what god damn
nightmares applets […]

### [OpenCV with Tkinter](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/05/23/opencv-with-tkinter)
I’ll be honest with you. I’m not much of a GUI developer. Never was one, never
will be. I enjoy creating the occasional user interface with HTML + CSS, or
hacking up a WordPress plugin to make it more aesthetically pleasing — but
writing full-fledged GUIs was never something I enjoyed. That said, I do try

can be a huge pain in the ass. My intention with this tutorial is to help you
get started writing videos to file with OpenCV 3, provide (and explain) some
boilerplate code, and detail how I got video writing to work on […]

### [OpenCV Saliency Detection](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/16/opencv-saliency-detection)
Today’s tutorial is on saliency detection, the process of applying image
processing and computer vision algorithms to automatically locate the most
“salient” regions of an image. In essence, saliency is what “stands out” in a
photo or scene, enabling your eye-brain connection to quickly (and essentially
unconsciously) focus on the most important regions. For example — […]


## Contours

### [Finding extreme points in contours with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/11/finding-extreme-points-in-contours-with-opencv)
A few weeks ago, I demonstrated how to order the (x, y)-coordinates of a
rotated bounding box in a clockwise fashion — an extremely useful skill that
is critical in many computer vision applications, including (but not limited
to) perspective transforms and computing the dimensions of an object in an
image. One PyImageSearch reader emailed in, […]

### [OpenCV shape detection](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/02/08/opencv-shape-detection)
This tutorial is the second post in our three part series on shape detection
and analysis. Last week we learned how to compute the center of a contour
using OpenCV. Today, we are going to leverage contour properties to actually
label and identify shapes in an image, just like in the figure at the top of
this post. […]

### [OpenCV center of contour](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/02/01/opencv-center-of-contour)
Today, we are going to start a new 3-part series of tutorials on shape
detection and analysis. Throughout this series, we’ll learn how to: Compute
the center of a contour/shape region. Recognize various shapes, such as
circles, squares, rectangles, triangles, and pentagons using only contour
properties. Label the color of a shape. While today’s post is […]

### [Sorting Contours using Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/04/20/sorting-contours-using-python-and-opencv)
Alright, so at this point you have been exposed to contours pretty heavily on
the PyImageSearch blog. We used contours to build a kick-ass mobile document
scanner. Contours enabled us detect barcodes in images. And we even leveraged
the power of contours to find the distance from a camera to object or marker.
But there […]

### [Removing contours from an image using Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/02/09/removing-contours-image-using-python-opencv)
Awhile back I was going through /r/computervision when I stumbled across a
question asking how to remove contours from an image using OpenCV. Intrigued,
I posted a reply. The basic algorithm for removing contours from an image goes
something like this: Step 1: Detect and find contours in your image. Step 2:
Loop over contours individually. Step […]


## Image Processing

### [Rotate images (correctly) with OpenCV and Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/01/02/rotate-images-correctly-with-opencv-and-python)
Let me tell you an embarrassing story of how I wasted three weeks of research
time during graduate school six years ago. It was the end of my second
semester of coursework. I had taken all of my exams early and all my projects
for the semester had been submitted. Since my school obligations were
essentially nil, I started experimenting […]

### [Image hashing with OpenCV and Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/11/27/image-hashing-opencv-python)
Today’s blog post is on image hashing — and it’s the hardest blog post I’ve
ever had to write. Image hashing isn’t a particularly hard technique (in fact,
it’s one of the easiest algorithms I’ve taught here on the PyImageSearch
blog). But the subject matter and underlying reason of why I’m covering image
hashing today […]

### [Long exposure with OpenCV and Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/08/14/long-exposure-with-opencv-and-python)
One of my favorite photography techniques is long exposure, the process of
creating a photo that shows the effect of passing time, something that
traditional photography does not capture. When applying this technique, water
becomes silky smooth, stars in a night sky leave light trails as the earth
rotates, and car headlights/taillights illuminate highways in […]

### [Labeling superpixel colorfulness with OpenCV and Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/06/26/labeling-superpixel-colorfulness-opencv-python)
After our previous post on computing image colorfulness was published,
Stephan, a PyImageSearch reader, left a comment on the tutorial asking if
there was a method to compute the colorfulness of specific regions of an image
(rather than the entire image). There are multiple ways of attacking this
problem. The first could be to apply […]

### [Computing image “colorfulness” with OpenCV and Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/06/05/computing-image-colorfulness-with-opencv-and-python)
Today’s blog post is inspired by a question I received from a PyImageSearch
reader on Twitter, @makingyouthink. Paraphrasing the tweets myself and
@makingyouthink exchanged, the question was: Have you ever seen a Python
implementation of Measuring colourfulness in natural images (Hasler and
Süsstrunk, 2003)? I would like to use it as an image/produce search engine.

### [Montages with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/05/29/montages- with-opencv)
Today’s blog post is inspired by an email I received from PyImageSearch
reader, Brian. Brian asks: Hi Adrian, I’m really enjoying the PyImageSearch
blog. I found your site a few days ago and I’ve been hooked on your tutorials
ever since. I followed your tutorial on building an image search engine, but
instead of displaying […]

### [Seam carving with OpenCV, Python, and scikit- image](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/01/23/seam-carving-with-opencv-python-and-scikit-image)
Easily one of my all-time favorite papers in computer vision literature is
Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing by Avidan and Shamir from
Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs (MERL). Originally published in the SIGGRAPH
2007 proceedings, I read this paper for the first time during my computational
photography class as an undergraduate student. This paper, along with […]

### [Intersection over Union (IoU) for object detection](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/11/07/intersection-over-union-iou-for-object-detection)
Today’s blog post is inspired from an email I received from Jason, a student
at the University of Rochester. Jason is interested in building a custom
object detector using the HOG + Linear SVM framework for his final year
project. He understands the steps required to build the object detector well
enough — but he isn’t […]

### [Detecting multiple bright spots in an image with Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/31/detecting-multiple-bright-spots-in-an-image-with-python-and-opencv)
Today’s blog post is a followup to a tutorial I did a couple of years ago on
finding the brightest spot in an image. My previous tutorial assumed there was
only one bright spot in the image that you wanted to detect… …but what if
there were multiple bright spots? If you want to detect more than […]

### [Watermarking images with OpenCV and Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/25/watermarking-images-with opencv-and-python)
A few weeks ago, I wrote a blog post on creating transparent overlays with
OpenCV. This post was meant to be a gentle introduction to a neat little trick
you can use to improve the aesthetics of your processed image(s), such as
creating a Heads-up Display (HUD) on live video streams. But there’s another,
more practical […]

### [Transparent overlays with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/03/07/transparent-overlays-with-opencv)
One of my favorite aspects of running the PyImageSearch blog is sharing little
bitesize OpenCV tips and tricks that I’ve learned after nearly 7 years of
using the OpenCV library. Today’s tip comes from my bag of experiences:
constructing transparent overlays with OpenCV. In order to construct a
transparent overlay, you need two images: Your original image. An […]


## Measure

### [Ordering coordinates clockwise with Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/03/21/ordering-coordinates-clockwise-with-python-and-opencv)
Today we are going to kick-off a three part series on calculating the size of
objects in images along with measuring the distances between them. These
tutorials have been some of the most heavily requested lessons on the
PyImageSearch blog. I’m super excited to get them underway — and I’m sure you
are too. However, before we start learning how to […]

### [Measuring distance between objects in an image with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/04/measuring-distance-between-objects-in-an-image-with-opencv)
We have now reached the final installment in our three part series on
measuring the size of objects in an image and computing the distance between
objects. Two weeks ago, we started this round of tutorials by learning how to
(correctly) order coordinates in a clockwise manner using Python and OpenCV.
Then, last week, we discussed how to […]

### [Measuring size of objects in an image with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/03/28/measuring-size-of-objects-in-an-image-with-opencv)
Measuring the size of an object (or objects) in an image has been a heavily
requested tutorial on the PyImageSearch blog for some time now — and it feels
great to get this post online and share it with you. Today’s post is the
second in a three part series on measuring the size of objects in an […]

### [Determining object color with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/02/15/determining-object-color-with-opencv)
This is the final post in our three part series on shape detection and
analysis. Previously, we learned how to: Compute the center of a contour
Perform shape detection & identification Today we are going to perform both
shape detection and color labeling on objects in images. At this point, we
understand that regions of an image […]

### [Real-time panorama and image stitching with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/01/25/real-time-panorama-and-image-stitching-with-opencv)
One of my favorite parts of running the PyImageSearch blog is a being able to
link together previous blog posts and create a solution to a particular
problem — in this case, real-time panorama and image stitching with Python and
OpenCV. Over the past month and a half, we’ve learned how to increase the FPS

### [Multiple cameras with the Raspberry Pi and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/01/18/multiple-cameras-with-the-raspberry-pi-and-opencv)
I’ll keep the introduction to today’s post short, since I think the title of
this post and GIF animation above speak for themselves. Inside this post, I’ll
demonstrate how to attach multiple cameras to your Raspberry Pi…and access all
of them using a single Python script. Regardless if your setup includes:
Multiple USB webcams. Or the Raspberry […]

### [OpenCV panorama stitching](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/01/11/opencv-panorama-stitching)
In today’s blog post, I’ll demonstrate how to perform image stitching and
panorama construction using Python and OpenCV. Given two images, we’ll
“stitch” them together to create a simple panorama, as seen in the example
above. To construct our image panorama, we’ll utilize computer vision and
image processing techniques such as: keypoint detection and local invariant

### [Local Binary Patterns with Python & OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/12/07/local-binary-patterns-with-python-opencv)
Well. I’ll just come right out and say it. Today is my 27th birthday. As a kid
I was always super excited about my birthday. It was another year closer to
being able to drive a car. Go to R rated movies. Or buy alcohol. But now as an
adult, I don’t care too much for my […]

### [HOG detectMultiScale parameters explained](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/11/16/hog-detectmultiscale-parameters-explained)
Last week we discussed how to use OpenCV and Python to perform pedestrian
detection. To accomplish this, we leveraged the built-in HOG + Linear SVM
detector that OpenCV ships with, allowing us to detect people in images.
However, one aspect of the HOG person detector we did not discuss in detail is
the detectMultiScale  function; specifically, […]

### [Pedestrian Detection OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/11/09/pedestrian-detection-opencv)
I’ve met a lot of amazing, uplifting people over the years. My PhD advisor who
helped get me through graduate school. My father who was always there for me
as a kid — and still is now. And my girlfriend who has always been positive,
helpful, and supportive (even when I probably didn’t deserve it). I’ve also
[…]

### [Watershed OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/11/02/watershed-opencv)
The watershed algorithm is a classic algorithm used for segmentation and is
especially useful when extracting touching or overlapping objects in images,
such as the coins in the figure above. Using traditional image processing
methods such as thresholding and contour detection, we would be unable to
extract each individual coin from the image — but by leveraging the […]

### [Analyzing 91 years of Time magazine covers for visual trends](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/10/19/analyzing-91-years-of-time-magazine-covers-for-visual-trends)
Today’s blog post will build on what we learned from last week: how to
construct an image scraper using Python + Scrapy to scrape ~4,000 Time
magazine cover images. So now that we have this dataset, what are we going to
do with it? Great question. One of my favorite visual analysis techniques to
apply […]

### [Scraping images with Python and Scrapy](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/10/12/scraping-images-with-python-and-scrapy)
Since this is a computer vision and OpenCV blog, you might be wondering: “Hey
Adrian, why in the world are you talking about scraping images?” Great
question. The reason is because image acquisition is one of the most under-
talked about subjects in the computer vision field! Think about it. Whether
you’re leveraging machine learning to train an image classifier, building […]

### [OpenCV Gamma Correction](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/10/05/opencv-gamma-correction)
Did you know that the human eye perceives color and luminance differently than
the sensor on your smartphone or digital camera? You see, when twice the
number of photons hit the sensor of a digital camera, it receives twice the
signal (a linear relationship). However, that’s not how our human eyes work.
Instead, we perceive double the amount […]

### [Implementing the Max RGB filter in OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/28/implementing-the-max-rgb-filter-in-opencv)
Today’s blog post comes straight out of the PyImageSearch Gurus course. Inside
PyImageSearch Gurus we have a community page (much like a combination of
forums + Q&A + StackOverflow) where we discuss a variety of computer vision
topics, ask questions, and hold each other accountable to learning computer
vision and image processing. This post was […]

### [OpenCV Track Object Movement](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/21/opencv-track-object-movement)
This past Saturday, I was caught in the grips of childhood nostalgia, so I
busted out my PlayStation 1 and my original copy of Final Fantasy VII. As a
kid in late middle school/early high school, I logged 70+ hours playing
through this heartbreaking, inspirational, absolute masterpiece of an RPG. As
a kid in middle […]

### [Ball Tracking with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv)
Today marks the 100th blog post on PyImageSearch. 100 posts. It’s hard to
believe it, but it’s true. When I started PyImageSearch back in January of
2014, I had no idea what the blog would turn into. I didn’t know how it would
evolve and mature. And I most certainly did not know how popular it would […]

### [Blur detection with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/07/blur-detection-with-opencv)
Between myself and my father, Jemma, the super-sweet, hyper-active, extra-
loving family beagle may be the most photographed dog of all time. Since we
got her as a 8-week old puppy, to now, just under three years later, we have
accumulated over 6,000+ photos of the dog. Excessive? Perhaps. But I love
dogs. A lot. Especially beagles. So […]

### [How to find functions by name in OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/08/31/how-to-find-functions-by-name-in-opencv)
OpenCV can be a big, hard to navigate library, especially if you are just
getting started learning computer vision and image processing. The release of
OpenCV 3 has only further complicated matters, moving a few important
functions around and even slightly altering their names (the cv2.cv.BoxPoints
vs. cv2.boxPoints  methods come to mind off the top of my head). […]

### [The perfect computer vision environment: PyCharm, OpenCV, and Python virtual environments](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/08/17/the-perfect-computer-vision-environment-pycharm-opencv-and-python-virtual-environments)
You know what makes for a (not so) fun weekend? Reconfiguring and reinstalling
OSX on your MacBook Pro. Apparently, the 13in MacBook Pro that I use when I’m
traveling decided to shit the bed. No worries though, I use Carbon Copy Cloner
and Backblaze, so no data was lost. And to be honest, I was […]

### [Home surveillance and motion detection with the Raspberry Pi, Python, OpenCV, and Dropbox](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/01/home-surveillance-and-motion-detection-with-the-raspberry-pi-python-and-opencv)
Wow, last week’s blog post on building a basic motion detection system was
awesome. It was a lot of fun to write and the feedback I got from readers like
yourself made it well worth the effort to put together. For those of you who
are just tuning it, last week’s post on building a motion detection […]

### [Basic motion detection and tracking with Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and tracking-with-python-and-opencv)
That son of a bitch. I knew he took my last beer. These are words a man should
never, ever have to say. But I muttered them to myself in an exasperated sigh
of disgust as I closed the door to my refrigerator. You see, I had just spent
over 12 hours writing content for the upcoming […]

### [Target acquired: Finding targets in drone and quadcopter video streams using Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/04/target-acquired-finding-targets-in-drone-and-quadcopter-video-streams-using-python-
and-opencv)
I’m going to start this post by clueing you in on a piece of personal history
that very few people know about me: as a kid in early high school, I used to
spend nearly every single Saturday at the local RC (Remote Control) track
about 25 miles from my house. You see, I used to […]

### [Implementing RootSIFT in Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/04/13/implementing-rootsift-in-python-and-opencv)
Still using the original, plain ole’ implementation of SIFT by David Lowe?
Well, according to Arandjelovic and Zisserman in their 2012 paper, Three
things everyone should know to improve object retrieval, you’re selling
yourself (and your accuracy) short by using the original implementation.
Instead, you should be utilizing a simple extension to SIFT, called RootSIFT,
that can […]

### [Zero-parameter, automatic Canny edge detection with Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/04/06/zero-parameter-automatic-canny-edge-detection-with-python-and-opencv)
Today I’ve got a little trick for you, straight out of the PyImageSearch
vault. This trick is really awesome — and in many cases, it completely
alleviates the need to tune the parameters to your Canny edge detectors. But
before we get into that, let’s discuss the Canny edge detector a bit. Looking
for the source code […]

### [Accessing the Raspberry Pi Camera with OpenCV and Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/30/accessing-the-raspberry-pi-camera-with-opencv-and-python)
Over the past year the PyImageSearch blog has had a lot of popular blog posts.
Using k-means clustering to find the dominant colors in an image was (and
still is) hugely popular. One of my personal favorites, building a kick-ass
mobile document scanner has been the most popular PyImageSearch article for
months. And the first (big) […]

### [Sliding Windows for Object Detection with Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/23/sliding-windows-for-object-detection-with-python-and-opencv)
So in last week’s blog post we discovered how to construct an image pyramid.
And in today’s article, we are going to extend that example and introduce the
concept of a sliding window. Sliding windows play an integral role in object
classification, as they allow us to localize exactly “where” in an image an
object resides. […]

### [Image Pyramids with Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/16/image-pyramids-with-python-and-opencv)
It’s too damn cold up in Connecticut — so cold that I had to throw in the
towel and escape for a bit. Last week I took a weekend trip down to Orlando,
FL just to escape. And while the weather wasn’t perfect (mid-60 degrees
Fahrenheit, cloudy, and spotty rain, as you can see from the […]

### [Capturing mouse click events with Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/09/capturing-mouse-click-events-with-python-and-opencv)
Being raised on the east coast of the United States I guess I should be used
to the snow by now — but I’m not. As a kid, I loved the snow. I loved
sledding, snowboarding, and snowball fights. But now, as an adult, snow just
means an inconvenience. It means travel is going to […]

### [Convert URL to image with Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/02/convert-url-to-image-with-python-and-opencv)
Today’s blog post comes directly from my own personal repository of utility
functions. Over the past month I’ve gotten a handful of PyImageSearch readers
emailing in and asking how to download an image from a URL and then convert it
to OpenCV format (without writing it to disk and then reading it back) — and

### [(Faster) Non-Maximum Suppression in Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/02/16/faster-non-maximum-suppression-python)
I have issues — I can’t stop thinking about object detection. You see, last
night I was watching The Walking Dead and instead of enjoying the zombie
brutality, the forced cannibalism, or the enthralling storyline, all I wanted
to do was build an object detection system to recognize zombies. Would it be
very useful? Probably not. I mean, it’s […]

### [Multi-scale Template Matching using Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/01/26/multi-scale-template-matching-using-python-opencv)
This past weekend I’ve been really sick with the flu. I haven’t done much
besides lay on my couch, sip chicken noodle soup from a coffee mug, and
marathon gaming sessions of Call of Duty. It’s honestly been years since I’ve
spent a weekend relentlessly playing Call of Duty. Getting online and playing
endless rounds of […]

### [Find distance from camera to object/marker using Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/01/19/find-distance-camera-objectmarker-using-python-opencv)
A couple of days ago, Cameron, a PyImageSearch reader emailed in and asked
about methods to find the distance from a camera to an object/marker in an
image. He had spent some time researching, but hadn’t found an implementation.
I knew exactly how Cameron felt. Years ago I was working on a small project to

### [Accessing Individual Superpixel Segmentations with Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/12/29/accessing-individual-superpixel-segmentations-python)
There were three huge influences in my life that made me want to become a
scientist. The first was David A. Johnston, an American USGS volcanologist who
died on May 18th, 1980, the day of the catastrophic eruption of Mount St.
Helens in Washington state. He was the first to report the eruption,
exclaiming “Vancouver! […]

### [Non-Maximum Suppression for Object Detection in Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/11/17/non-maximum-suppression-object-detection-python)
Connecticut is cold. Very cold. Sometimes it’s hard to even get out of bed in
the morning. And honestly, without the aide of copious amounts of pumpkin
spice lattes and the beautiful sunrise over the crisp autumn leaves, I don’t
think I would leave my cozy bed. But I have work to do. And today […]

### [Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Object Detection](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/11/10/histogram-oriented-gradients-object-detection)
If you’ve been paying attention to my Twitter account lately, you’ve probably
noticed one or two teasers of what I’ve been working on — a Python
framework/package to rapidly construct object detectors using Histogram of
Oriented Gradients and Linear Support Vector Machines. Honestly, I really
can’t stand using the Haar cascade classifiers provided by OpenCV […]

### [OpenCV Shape Descriptor: Hu Moments Example](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/10/27/opencv-shape-descriptor-hu-moments-example)
So what type of shape descriptors does OpenCV provide? The most notable are Hu
Moments which are can be used to describe, characterize, and quantify the
shape of an object in an image. Hu Moments are normally extracted from the
silhouette or outline of an object in an image. By describing the silhouette
or outline […]

### [Finding Shapes in Images using Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/10/20/finding-shapes-images-using-python-opencv)
Before we dive into this post, let’s take a second and talk about Oscar, a
dedicated PyImageSearch reader. He is just getting started in computer vision
— and he’s taken the best possible route to mastering the subject: creating
your own projects and solving them. Oscar picked up a copy of my book,
Practical Python and […]

### [Finding the Brightest Spot in an Image using Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/29/finding-brightest-spot-image-using-python-opencv)
Originally I had intended on doing a followup post on my Getting Started with
Deep Learning Guide, but due to some unfortunate personal events, I wasn’t
able to complete the blog post. But don’t worry…I still have a really great
tutorial for you today! Bad tutorials are worse than warm beer. You want to
know […]
  
### [Thresholding: Simple Image Segmentation using OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/08/thresholding-simple-image-segmentation-using-opencv)
Tragic. Heartbreaking. Unbearable. These are the three words that I would use
to describe my past week. About a week ago, a close childhood friend of mine
passed away in a tragic car accident. I went to elementary school and middle
school with him. We spent our summers skateboarding on my driveway and the
winters […]

### [4 Point OpenCV getPerspective Transform Example](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/08/25/4-point-opencv-getperspective-transform-example)
4:18am. Alarm blaring. Still dark outside. The bed is warm. And the floor will
feel so cold on my bare feet. But I got out of bed. I braved the morning, and
I took the ice cold floor on my feet like a champ. Why? Because I’m excited.
Excited to share something very special with […]

### [Skin Detection: A Step-by-Step Example using Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/08/18/skin-detection-step-step-example-using-python-opencv)
So last night I went out for a few drinks with my colleague, James, a fellow
computer vision researcher who I have known for years. You see, James likes to
party. He’s a “go hard” type of guy. He wanted to hit every single bar on
Washington St. (there’s a lot of them)…and then hit ’em […]

### [OpenCV and Python Color Detection](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/08/04/opencv-python-color-detection)
So, here I am. Riding the Amtrak 158 train, coming home after a long business
trip. It’s hot. The AC is barely working. A baby is screaming right next to me
while the accompanying mother looks forlornly out the window, clearly
questioning whether or not having a child was the right life decision. And to

### [Segmentation: A SLIC Superpixel Tutorial using Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/07/28/a-slic-superpixel-tutorial-using-python)
Have you ever had a horrible case of eyelid twitching? One where your eyelid
just won’t stop spazzing out, no matter what you do? That’s currently what’s
going on with me — and it’s been going on for over two weeks. As you can
imagine, I’m not exactly happy. However, to combat this persistent, often
distracting nuisance, […]

### [Detecting Circles in Images using OpenCV and Hough Circles](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/07/21/detecting-circles-images-using-opencv-hough-circles)
A few days ago, I got an email from a PyImageSearch reader asking about circle
detection. See below for the gist: Hey Adrian, Love your blog. I saw your post
on detecting rectangles/squares in images, but I was wondering, how do you
detect circles in images using OpenCV? Thanks. Great question. As you’ve
probably already […]

feel was given to it in the post-processing steps — but it was a painstaking
process. For each frame in the movie, animators traced over the original
footage, frame by frame. Just take a second to consider the number of frames

### [Super fast color transfer between images](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/06/30/super-fast-color-transfer-images)
About a month ago, I spent a morning down at the beach, walking along the
sand, letting the crisp, cold water lap against my feet. It was tranquil,
relaxing. I then took out my iPhone and snapped a few photos of the ocean and
clouds passing by. You know, something to remember the moment by. Because […]

### [Announcing “Case Studies: Solving real world problems with computer vision”](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/06/26/announcing-case-studies-solving-real-world-problems-computer-vision)
I have some big news to announce today… Besides writing a ton of blog posts
about computer vision, image processing, and image search engines, I’ve been
behind the scenes, working on a second book. And you may be thinking, hey,
didn’t you just finish up Practical Python and OpenCV? Yep. I did. Now, don’t
get […]

### [OpenCV and Python K-Means Color Clustering](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/05/26/opencv-python-k-means-color-clustering)
Take a second to look at the Jurassic Park movie poster above. What are the
dominant colors? (i.e. the colors that are represented most in the image)
Well, we see that the background is largely black. There is some red around
the T-Rex. And there is some yellow surrounding the actual logo. It’s pretty
simple for the human […]

### [Building a Pokedex in Python: Comparing Shape Descriptors with OpenCV (Step 6 of 6)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/05/19/building-pokedex-python-comparing-shape-descriptors-opencv)
Here we are, the final step of building a real-life Pokedex in Python and
OpenCV. This is where it all comes together. We’ll glue all our pieces
together and put together an image search engine based on shape features. We
explored what it takes to build a Pokedex using computer vision. Then we
scraped the web […]

### [Building a Pokedex in Python: OpenCV and Perspective Warping (Step 5 of 6)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/05/05/building-pokedex-python-opencv-perspective-warping-step-5-6)
We’re getting closer to finishing up our real-life Pokedex! In my previous
blog post, I showed you how to find a Game Boy screen in an image using Python
and OpenCV. This post will show you how to apply warping transformations to
obtain a “birds-eye-view” of the Game Boy screen. From there, we will be […]

### [Building a Pokedex in Python: Finding the Game Boy Screen (Step 4 of 6)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/04/21/building-pokedex-python-finding-game-boy-screen-step-4-6)
Quick question. How does a Pokedex work? Well, you simply point it a Pokemon,
the Pokedex examines its physical characteristics, and the Pokemon is
identified instantly. In this case, our smartphone camera is our “Pokedex”. We
point our smartphone at our Game Boy, snap a photo of it, and our rival
Pokemon is identified (if […]

### [Building a Pokedex in Python: Indexing our Sprites using Shape Descriptors (Step 3 of 6)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/04/07/building-pokedex-python-indexing-sprites-using-shape-descriptors-step-3-6)
So, how is our Pokedex going to “know” what Pokemon is in an image? How are we
going to describe each Pokemon? Are we going to characterize the color of the
Pokemon? The texture? Or the shape? Well, do you remember playing Who’s that
Pokemon as a kid? You were able to identify the Pokemon […]

### [Building a Pokedex in Python: Scraping the Pokemon Sprites (Step 2 of 6)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/03/24/building-pokedex-python-scraping-pokemon-sprites-step-2-6)
What if we could build a real life Pokedex? You know, just like Ash Ketchum —
point your Pokedex at a Pokemon (or in this case, snap a photo of a Pokemon),
identify it, and get its stats. While this idea has its roots in the Pokemon
TV show, I’m going to show you how […]

### [Building a Pokedex in Python: Getting Started (Step 1 of 6)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/03/10/building-pokedex-python-getting-started-step-1-6)
So you’re telling me that we are going to build a Pokedex in Python that can
visually recognize Pokemon? Just like in the TV show? – Ash Ketchum Yes, Ash.
That’s exactly what I’m telling you. The next series of blog posts will be
dedicated to building a Pokedex that can visually recognize Pokemon from the
[…]

### [Image Difference with OpenCV and Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/06/19/image-difference-with-opencv-and-python)
In a previous PyImageSearch blog post, I detailed how to compare two images
with Python using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). Using this method,
we were able to easily determine if two images were identical or had
differences due to slight image manipulations, compression artifacts, or
purposeful tampering. Today we are going to extend the […]

### [How-To: Python Compare Two Images](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/15/python-compare-two-images)
Would you have guessed that I’m a stamp collector? Just kidding. I’m not. But
let’s play a little game of pretend. Let’s pretend that we have a huge dataset
of stamp images. And we want to take two arbitrary stamp images and compare
them to determine if they are identical, or near identical in some […]

### [How-To: 3 Ways to Compare Histograms using OpenCV and Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/07/14/3-ways-compare-histograms-using-opencv-python)
So you’ve extracted color histograms from a set of images… But how are you
going to compare them for similarity? You’ll need a distance function to
handle that. But which one? How you choose? And how do you compare histograms
using Python and OpenCV? Don’t worry, I’ve got you covered. In this blog post
I’ll […]

histograms-a-how-to-guide-to-building-your-first-image-search-engine-in-
python)
One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them; One ring to bring them all
and in the darkness bind them. The image search engine we are about to build
is going to be so awesome, it could have destroyed The One Ring itself,
without the help of the fires of Mt. Doom. […]

### [Adding a web interface to our image search engine with Flask](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/12/08/adding-web-interface-image-search-engine-flask)
This is a guest post by Michael Herman from Real Python – learn Python
programming and web development through hands-on, interesting examples that
are useful and fun! In this tutorial, we’ll take the command line image search
engine from the previous tutorial and turn it into a full-blown web
application using Python and Flask. More specifically, […]

### [The complete guide to building an image search engine with Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/12/01/complete-guide-building-image-search-engine-python-opencv)
Let’s face it. Trying to search for images based on text and tags sucks.
Whether you are tagging and categorizing your personal images, searching for
stock photos for your company website, or simply trying to find the right
image for your next epic blog post, trying to use text and keywords to
describe something that […]
