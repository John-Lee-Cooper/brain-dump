## Welcome to [GitHub Pages](https://john-lee-cooper.github.io/hello-world/)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/John-Lee-Cooper/hello-world/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for


Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__

Combined emphasis with **_asterisks and _underscores_**

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

Inline Code with `back ticks`

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces.
I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
