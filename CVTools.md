# 1. Install 
  * pyenv
  * Python 3.7
  * pipenv
  * OpenCV 4
  * OpenCV
  * NumPy

The four OpenCV packages that are pip-installable on the PyPI repository:

  * _opencv-python_: Contains just the main modules of the OpenCV library.
  * _opencv-contrib-python_: Contains both the main modules and the contrib modules.
  * _opencv-python-headless_: Same as opencv-python but no GUI functionality.
  * _opencv-contrib-python-headless_: Same as opencv-contrib-python but no GUI functionality.

In most situations you want to install opencv-contrib-python on your system.
You **do not** want to install both opencv-python and opencv-contrib-python.

A little trick for checking available versions:
`pip install opencv-contrib-python==`  

Install:
`pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.0.0.21`
