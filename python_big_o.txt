List Operations

  1. Insert: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(n)
  2. Get Item: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(1)
  3. Delete Item: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(n)
  4. Iteration: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(n)
  5. Get Length: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(1)


Set Operations

Sets are also one of the most widely used data collections in Python. A set is essentially an unordered collection. Set does not permit duplicates and hence each item in a set is unique. Set supports many mathematical operations such as union, difference, the intersection of sets and so on.

  1. Check for item in set: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(1)
  2. Difference of set A from B: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(length of A)
  3. Intersection of set A and B: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(minimum of the length of either A or B)
  4. Union of set A and B: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(N) with respect to length(A) + length(B)


Dictionary Operations

Lastly, I wanted to provide an overview of the dictionary data collection. Dictionary is a key-value pair collection. Keys are unique in a dictionary to prevent item collision. It is an extremely useful data collection.
Dictionaries are indexed by keys, where the keys could be strings, numbers or even tuples with strings, numbers or tuples.
We can perform a number of operations on a dictionary such as storing a value for a key, or retrieving an item based on a key, or iterating over the items and so on.
common dictionary time complexities:

  1. Get Item: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(1)
  2. Set Item: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(1)
  3. Delete Item: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(1)
  4. Iterate Over Dictionary: It’s Big-O Notation Is O(n)
